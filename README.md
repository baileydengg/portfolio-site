Note: I am submitting a portfolio that I made prior to this course.
In terms of thigns I have changed since making it in the past, I removed unnecessary elements and simplified everything overall.
This includes removing a 'skills' section as well as making sure the portfolio would dynamically adjust for other screens.

I believe that I completed all of the possible assignment points. While I initially created this portfolio in October last year and had made small changes here and there, since A1 was announced, 
I have worked on it for a little over a week.
